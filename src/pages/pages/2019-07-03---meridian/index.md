​"War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner."
​<span style="text-align: right; display: block">-Cormac McCarthy, _Blood Meridian, or The Evening Redness in the West_</span>

Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel _Blood Meridian, or The Evening Redness in the West_ follows the Glanton Gang, a group of mercenaries contracted by the Mexican government to hunt Native Americans in 1849. The "Meridian" collection frames the thematic dichotomies of the novel within the psychological theory of Sigmund Freud. Starved from civilization on the eschatological American frontier, the Superego is suppressed and the carnal Id overcomes.

​A double shouldered tailored jacket a pinstripe wool suiting exaggerates the silhouette, summoning the towering menace of McCarthy's Judge Holden---an archon---the manifestation of Freud's Id. Knee length chaps are cinched tightly over a pair of charcoal gray wool trousers, each leg engraved with an inverted cross seam; the shape of the crucifixion of Saint Peter. A military shirt is reduced to a pattern of only six pieces and reinforced with dramatically contrasting flat felled seams, some magnified in proportion and others eliminated completely from the construction through asymmetrical cutting techniques. A long sleeved knit top is contorted by curved and elongated seams. Winding coverstitch detailing in contrasting white thread descends the torso and arms; the tracks of an expedition, the borders of an expanding nation.

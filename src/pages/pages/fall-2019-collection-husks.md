###### **_Husks_**

The Southern Gothic of literary tradition has ceased to exist. No longer do American southerners die at the hands of crops which refuse them fruit. They now face a second industrial revolution with the rise of automation. Farming jobs are rapidly disappearing as those who work with their hands are replaced by automated machinery. Combines and tractors lumber steadily through fields and there are no drivers at the wheel. There are no eyes to see and no hands to steer. Farmers are alienated from their labor. The work eclipses the worker.

Structured menswear silhouettes are fabricated in formidable workwear materials—heavyweight linen, smoke black cotton moleskin, and plum brown wool twill. A traditional four pocket barn coat is recreated with a tailored silhouette and vertical welt pockets. Shirts constructed with exaggerated volume deliberately imitate the outsized clothing donned by farmers for strictly utilitarian needs. Darts and articulated detailing lend an heir of futurist sleekness to contemporary workwear styles. An array of scarves, blankets, and folklore adornments ground the clothing in the tradition of the American south. It is the uniform of a near-future laborer who will never exist.
